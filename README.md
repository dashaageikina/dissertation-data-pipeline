# Short summary of the project:
The study seeks to examine the role that sociopolitical pressure may play in wildfire suppression decisions in the U.S. context. More specifically, it analyzes the effects of media coverage on wildfire suppression efforts, namely personnel and aircraft resources, using a rich empirical dataset on U.S. fire events between 1999 and 2014. The main challenge is to find the causal effect in contrast to a simple correlation. I use Instrumental Variable analysis to isolate the causal effect and find how media coverage contributes to wildfire suppression, keeping everything else equal. Key findings suggest that wildfires receiving more media coverage have more resources allocated to them, regardless of the actual threat level or the logistical needs of the fire suppression effort. This misallocation leads to inefficiencies in resource use and exacerbates future wildfire risks. The research contributes to the ongoing discourse on wildfire management and sociopolitical studies on media. It also highlights the need for optimal resource allocation during wildfire incidents, suggesting that a more nuanced understanding of media influence and public expectations is crucial for effective wildfire management.
